    <h1>Pneumonia Detection System using AI</h1>
    <p>Our project aims to develop a Pneumonia Detection System using AI. The system will be trained on a dataset of labelled lung X-Ray images, consisting of three categories - Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia. We will be using the FastAI Python library to build and train the deep learning model for classification.</p>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia Detection) dataset on Kaggle will be used for training and testing our model. This dataset consists of 5,856 chest X-ray images with three categories - Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The pre-trained ResNet50 model from FastAI will be used as the base model for training the classifier. This model allows us to train deep neural networks with over 150 layers, which will help us achieve better accuracy in detecting pneumonia from X-Ray images.</p>
    <p>We will use FastAI to preprocess the images and create data loaders for the training and testing data. We will then train the classifier on the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By building a Pneumonia Detection System using AI, we can help doctors and medical professionals make faster and more accurate diagnoses of pneumonia, which can lead to better patient outcomes.</p>
